- I’m interested in transforming pixels into meaningful insights to enhance agricultural water productivity, aiming to tackle the growing water and food insecurity challenges. I hold MSc in Water Science and Engineering from IHE Delft, the Netherlands. For more than six years, I have been engaged in agricultural water management with government organisations, international NOGs, educational institute and consultancy services in Asia, Africa (remote) and Europe.
- I’m currently learning python and R programming
- I’m looking to collaborate big data analysis for agriculural water managment and droughts managment
